# Libft  

Welcome to **Libft** !  
This project is all about building your own toolbox from scratch: rewriting standard C functions, adding powerful utilities, and even handling linked lists.  
Think of it as your **Swiss Army Knife for C projects**. 🔧

## What’s Inside?  

The library is split into three parts:  

1️⃣ **Part 1** – Reimplementation of standard C functions (like `strlen`, `strdup`, `memset`, etc.)  
2️⃣ **Part 2** – Extra utility functions for strings, memory, and conversions  
3️⃣ **Bonus** – A full set of **linked list functions**, to manipulate nodes like a pro

## 🛠️ How to Build

```bash
